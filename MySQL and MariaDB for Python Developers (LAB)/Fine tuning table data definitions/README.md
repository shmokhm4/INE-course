# 4th Lab in the Course: Fine Tuning Table Data Definitions ðŸ’«
This project will use the MySQL Data Definition Language to optimize the airline tweets that we moved into MySQL in an earlier project.

## Features âœ¨
- Create a new table `Tweets_new` from the existing `Tweets` table.
- Modify columns to use ENUM types for categorical data.
- Normalize the database by creating `airlines` and `timezones` tables.
- Add foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.
