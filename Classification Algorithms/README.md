# Classifying Penguins with Machine Learning: Third course in the ML Section 🙏✅
This project focuses on classifying penguin species using machine learning techniques. You will use classification algorithms to predict the species of penguins based on a variety of features such as body size, flipper length, and culmen measurements. 

## Features✨
- Load and explore the Penguins dataset
- Visualize the relationships between features using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
- Train and evaluate classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or other models) to predict penguin species
