# Decision Trees Course

## 🔬 Labs:

- **Mushroom Classification: Edible or Non-Edible 🍄**  
  In this project, I classify mushrooms into **edible** or **non-edible** categories using a Decision Tree algorithm. I preprocess the data, tune hyperparameters, and train the model to make predictions based on mushroom features.

- **Boston House Prices Regression 🏠**  
  In this project, I predict the prices of houses in Boston using a custom Machine Learning regression model. I create, tune, and evaluate the model from scratch, applying regression techniques to predict house prices based on various features.

- **Visualizing the Boston Regression Tree 🌳**  
  In this project, I validate my regression model through different visualizations. I use various strategies to visualize and interpret the Decision Tree, ensuring the model's performance and understanding how it makes predictions.
