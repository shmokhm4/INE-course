# Exceptions with Python: 8th course in python sectionüôè‚úÖ‚úÖ

This code forms the core of a word-guessing game. When a player starts a new 
game, a word is chosen and hidden, and the player guesses letters. Correct and incorrect guesses are tracked. 
If the player guesses all the letters correctly, they win. If the player runs out of attempts without discovering 
the word, they lose.

## Features
- Custom Exceptions (InvalidListOfWordsException, InvalidWordException, InvalidGuessedLetterException, GameLostException, GameWonException)
